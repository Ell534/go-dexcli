# go-dexcli
Go pokedex cli

Clone the repo then run the following when you're in the root directory of the project.
```bash
go build && ./go-dexcli
```
Once the REPL is running type 'help' for a list of commands.


A CLI REPL application which makes network requests to the pokeapi, parses JSON and implements a cache to improve performance.

I also included tests for the cache to learn about how testing works in Go.
